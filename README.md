# PID_Controller_for_self_balancing_robot
This Repo Demonstrates a self-balancing robot, equipped with an MPU6050 sensor and stepper motors, controlled by a PID controller implemented on an Arduino. The robot reads the tilt angle from the MPU6050 sensor and adjusts the motor speed to maintain balance using a PID Controller.
